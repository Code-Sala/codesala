            <p className="mt-2 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-500">
              One of the key contributions of data science to software
              development is its ability to improve decision-making. Through
              data analysis, developers can identify user behavior, optimize
              features, and predict potential issues before they arise. This
              data-driven approach ensures that software meets user expectations
              and delivers a seamless experience.

              Data science helps in monitoring and analyzing application
              performance. With tools like predictive analytics and anomaly
              detection, software developers can identify bottlenecks, security
              vulnerabilities, and inefficiencies in real-time. By leveraging
              historical data, software teams can enhance performance and
              reliability.
